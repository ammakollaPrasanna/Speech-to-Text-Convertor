# Speech-to-Text-Convertor
This project is a Speech-to-Text Converter integrated with a Minutes of Meeting (MoM) form. Users can directly speak into their microphone, and the spoken words are automatically transcribed into text fields in the form. The system helps in creating structured MoM reports, which can then be exported as PDF or Word documents.
